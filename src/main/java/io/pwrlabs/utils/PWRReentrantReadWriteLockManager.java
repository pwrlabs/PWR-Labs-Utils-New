/**
 * A utility class that manages named {@link PWRReentrantReadWriteLock} instances.
 *
 * <p>This manager provides a centralized registry for named read-write locks, allowing
 * different parts of an application to access the same lock by name. This enables
 * coordinated access to shared resources across multiple components without directly
 * sharing lock references.</p>
 *
 * <p>The manager uses a thread-safe map implementation to store locks, ensuring
 * that lock creation and retrieval operations are thread-safe.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * // Create a named lock
 * PWRReentrantReadWriteLock userDataLock = PWRReentrantReadWriteLockManager.createReadWriteLock("userData");
 *
 * // Later, in another component
 * Map&lt;String, PWRReentrantReadWriteLock&gt; locks = manager.getReadWriteLocksCopy();
 * PWRReentrantReadWriteLock sameUserDataLock = locks.get("userData");
 * </pre>
